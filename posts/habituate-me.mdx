# Habituate Me

Habituate Me is a full-stack web application that enables users to track their daily habits and create diary entries. It provides a user-friendly interface with features such as habit tracking, diary creation, and authentication. Users can view their habit history, add, edit, and delete their habits and diary entries, and see their progress over time.

## Technologies used

- React
- TypeScript
- NestJS
- Redux Toolkit
- SCSS

## Why I Created This

I created this app to help myself and others develop positive habits and keep track of their progress. The idea behind the app is to provide a simple and user-friendly way for people to track their habits and reflect on their daily experiences. I have been using this app daily for almost two years now and it has helped me stay  motivated towards achieving my goals.

## What's cool about it

- The application fulfills its intended purpose of tracking habits and creating diary entries, and has been used daily by me.
- The project provided an opportunity to learn and implement full-stack development with React, TypeScript, and NestJS, as well as Redux and Redux Toolkit for state management, SCSS for styling, and authentication techniques.
- The experience of maintaining the application over the course of almost two years has allowed for the development of skills related to managing and securing an application.
- The user interface is minimal and easy to use, exactly as I envisioned.

## What could be better

- The lack of comprehensive testing, while regrettable, was a result of limited experience with testing in React, TypeScript, and NestJS at the time of development.
- Some of the node modules used in the project are outdated, but upgrading them would require significant changes that are currently not feasible.
