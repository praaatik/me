# Stack Exchange Digest

## What is it?

Stack Exchange Digest is a small personal project that fetches the most recent questions from various Stack Exchange websites.

## Why did I create this project?

I found reading questions on Stack Exchange sites fun and exciting, but I couldn't find a place to get all the questions from the sites I followed in one place. So, I decided to create this project.

Additionally, I created this project to practice my recently learned ReactJS skills.

## What's cool about it?

Despite being a basic project with limited customization, I use it regularly. The project provides a centralized location for users to view recent questions from multiple Stack Exchange sites.

## What could be better?

As this is a small personal project, the scope is limited.
