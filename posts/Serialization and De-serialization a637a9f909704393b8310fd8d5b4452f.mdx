# Introduction

- Useful for persisting and transmitting data.
- We can _save_ objects and _load_ them later on even after the program has terminated.
- Creating a persistent representation of the object is **serializing** and reconstructing the object from the data is called **de-serializing**.
- _Pickling_ and _un-pickling_ is used in Python for this.

# Pickling and un-pickling

- This is Python specific to serialize and de-serialize objects.
- When we pickle one object and un-pickle it, the original object and new object are equal in the data but not in the memory address. So `==` returns a `True` but `is` would return a `False`.
- Shared objects remain the same, so if one object has a reference to another object, the un-picked one also has a reference to that same object.

## Using the `__getstate__` and `__setstate__`

- `__getstate__`can be used to make define what can and cannot be picked.

  ```jsx
  class Foo:
      def __init__(self):
          self.a = 35
          self.b = "thirty five"
          self.c = [35, "thirtyfive"]

      def __getstate__(self):
          attributes = self.__dict__.copy()
          del attributes['c']
          return attributes

  foo_instance = Foo()
  print(foo_instance.a, foo_instance.b, foo_instance.c, sep="\n")
  picked_string = pickle.dumps(foo_instance)
  unpicked_string = pickle.loads(picked_string)

  print(picked_string, unpicked_string, unpicked_string.__dict__)

  """
  35
  thirty five
  [35, 'thirtyfive']
  b'\x80\x04\x954\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x8c\x08__main__\x94\x8c\x03Foo\x94\x93\x94)\x81\x94}\x94(\x8c\x01a\x94K#\x8c\x01b\x94\x8c\x0bthirty five\x94ub.' <__main__.Foo object at 0x0000028231C98880> {'a': 35, 'b': 'thirty five'}
  """
  ```

- Similarly, `__setstate__` can be used in case of setting the state which will be used while pickling.

  ```jsx
  class Foo:
      def __init__(self):
          self.a = 35
          self.b = "thirty five"
          self.c = [35, "thirtyfive"]

      def __getstate__(self):
          attributes = self.__dict__.copy()
          del attributes['c']
          return attributes

      def __setstate__(self, state):
          print("this is the state", state, "something has been printing", sep="\n\n\n")
          self.__dict__ = state
          self.c = "something else entirely"

  foo_instance = Foo()
  print(foo_instance.a, foo_instance.b, foo_instance.c, sep="\n")
  picked_string = pickle.dumps(foo_instance)
  unpicked_string = pickle.loads(picked_string)

  print(picked_string, unpicked_string, unpicked_string.__dict__)

  """
  35
  thirty five
  [35, 'thirtyfive']
  this is the state

  {'a': 35, 'b': 'thirty five'}

  something has been printing
  b'\x80\x04\x954\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x8c\x08__main__\x94\x8c\x03Foo\x94\x93\x94)\x81\x94}\x94(\x8c\x01a\x94K#\x8c\x01b\x94\x8c\x0bthirty five\x94ub.' <__main__.Foo object at 0x0000028231CF9970> {'a': 35, 'b': 'thirty five', 'c': 'something else entirely'}
  """
  ```
