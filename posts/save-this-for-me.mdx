# Save This For Me

As an avid internet user, I wanted to create a tool that would make organizing and accessing my bookmarks easier. I built the web application Save This For Me as a hobby project to practice my coding skills and explore new technologies. The app allows you to create Collections to group bookmarks and keep them organized, favorite bookmarks, edit them, and delete them.

## Technologies used
- ReactJS
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Material-UI
- Supabase for backend and authentication
- Redux Toolkit Query for data fetching

## What's cool about it?

- I'm pleased with the simple yet pretty UI of the app, which I was able to create using my experience with Material UI.
- Writing tests for my project was a great experience.
- The app works as I envisioned, with a simple UI and effective bookmark organization.

## What could be better?

- I would have liked to include dynamic metadata like image and author information for bookmarks but didn't want to add extra network load or complexity to the app. I decided to keep it simple and skip that part, but still would have liked it to be included.
