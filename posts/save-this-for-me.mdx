# Save This For Me

As an avid internet user, I wanted to create a tool that would make organizing and accessing my bookmarks easier. I built the web application Save This For Me as a hobby project to practice my coding skills and explore new technologies. The app allows you to create collections to group bookmarks and keep them organized, favorite bookmarks, edit them, and delete them.

## Technologies used

I built this project using TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and Material-UI. I had prior experience with Material-UI, which made the development easier. I added tests for the first time, which was a great learning experience on how to write tests for an actual project that would be used. I also used RTK query for efficient state management and Supabase for authentication and database.

## What's cool about it?

- I'm pleased with the simple UI of the app, which I was able to create using my experience with Material UI.
- Writing tests for my project was a great learning experience and helped me to improve my skills.
- The app works as I envisioned, with a simple UI and effective bookmark organization.

## What could be better?

- I would have liked to include dynamic metadata like image and author information for bookmarks but didn't want to add extra network load or complexity to the app. To do that, however, I would require a backend to make those requests, adding an additional burden on the network. I decided to keep it simple and skip that part.
