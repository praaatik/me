# The `object` class

- When we define a class that does not explicitly inherit from another class, Python makes the class inherit from `object` class.
- This means that every class we create is a subclass of the `object` class (i.e. every object, functions, modules, etc.)

## Implications of inheriting from the `object` class

- Any class we create automatically inherits from the `object` class, so it inherits,
  - `__name__`
  - `__new__`
  - `__init__`
  - `__repr__`
    etc.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ To check the base classes of a class, use `__bases__`.

</aside>

## `__class__` and `__name__`

- **Objects** have a property `__class__` which **returns the class** the object was created from
- **Classes** have a property `__name__` which **returns a string having the name** of the class.
- To get the name of the class, use `__class__.__name__`.

```python
class Person:
  def eat(self):
    print("person eats")

  def sleep(self):
    print("person sleeps")

  def routine(self):
    self.sleep()
    self.eat()

class Student(Person):
  def sleep(self):
    print("student does not sleep")

  def routine(self):
    self.sleep()
    self.eat()

p1 = Person()
s1 = Student()

p1.routine()
"""
person sleeps
person eats
"""

# student takes the sleep() from student only since it has been overridden
s1.routine()
"""
student does not sleep
person eats
"""
```

## Delegating to Parent and using the **super()** keyword

- We can call the methods defined in the parent class using the `super()` keyword.

```python
class Parent(object):
  def __init__(self, name):
    print(f"calling the parent with {name}")

class Child1(Parent):
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    super().__init__(name)
    print(f"calling the child one with {age}")

c1 = Child1("pratik", 12)
"""
calling the parent with pratik
calling the child one with 12
"""
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ It is not mandatory to call `super()` before any other line like in Java. Although it is not safe to do so. See example below,

</aside>

```python
class Parent(object):
  def __init__(self, name):
    print(f"calling the parent with {name}")
    self.name = name

class Child1(Parent):
  def __init__(self, name, age):
		self.name = name + "1"  # value of name set to pratik1
    super().__init__(name)    # value override by the parent
    print(f"calling the child one with {age}")
    print(self.name)

c1 = Child1("pratik", 12)
"""
calling the parent with pratik
calling the child one with 12
pratik1
"""
```

## Delegation and method binding

- When we call a method from an instance, the method is **bound to the instance and not the parent.**

```python
class Person:
  def hello(self):
    print("In person, saying hello", self)

class Child(Person):
  def hello(self):
    print("In child, saying hello", self)
    super().hello()

c = Child()

c.hello()
"""
In child, saying hello <__main__.Child object at 0x7f86cecbd250>
In person, saying hello <__main__.Child object at 0x7f86cecbd250>
"""
```

- In the below way we can delegate the initialization to the parent (like in TensorFlow).

  ```python
  class Person(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
      self.name = name

  class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, student_number):
      super().__init__(name)
      self.student_number = student_number

  student = Student("pratik", 123)
  student.__dict__

  """
  {'name': 'pratik', 'student_number': 123}
  """
  ```
