# Descriptors

# Introduction

- Python **Descriptors** are simply objects that implement the _descriptor protocol_.
- The protocol is comprised of the following special methods - not all are required,
  - `__get__` - used to retrieve the property value
  - `__set__` - used to store the property value
  - `__del__` - used to delete the property from the instance
  - `__set_name__` - used to capture the property name as it is being defined in the owner class.
- Two types of descriptors,
  - **non data descriptors** - Only implement the `__get__` (and optionally `__set_name__`)
  - **data descriptors** - implement the `__set__` method and normally the `__get__` method.

## Simple example for a non-data descriptor

```python
class Choice:
    def __init__(self, *choices):
        self.choices = choices

    def __get__(self, instance, owner_class):
        return choice(self.choices)

class Deck:
    suit = Choice('Spade', 'Heart', 'Diamond', 'Club')
    card = Choice(*'23456789JQKA', '10')

seed(0)

d = Deck()

for _ in range(10):
    print(d.card, d.suit)
```

## Signature of the `__get__` and `__set__`

- `__get__` has two arguments, `instance` and `owner_class`.
  - `instance` â†’ which instance has this `__get__` been called from?
  - `owner_class` â†’ who is the owner class

```python
class RandomName:
    names = ["django", "pota", "kitty", "mikki"]
    def __get__(self, instance, owner_class):
        print(f"__get__ called from {self.__class__.__name__} for instance = {instance} and owner_class = {owner_class}.")
        return random.choice(self.names)

class Person:
    name = RandomName()

    def get_name(self):
        return self.name

p1 = Person()
p1.get_name()
"""
__get__ called from RandomName for instance = <__main__.Person object at 0x7f016ad475b0> and owner_class = <class '__main__.Person'>.
'mikki'
"""
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ We choose to return the following from a `__get__`,
1. return descriptor **instance** if the called from the **class** itself.
2. return attribute **value** if called from the instance of the class.

</aside>

- `__set__` signature is similar and has two arguments, `instance` and `value`

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Notice that there is no `owner_class` in `__set__` as we call setters and deleters from instances.

</aside>

## Creating a descriptor and behaving similar to the way properties work

```python
from datetime import datetime

class TimeUTC:
    def __get__(self, instance, owner_class):
        if instance is None:
            # called from class
            return self
        else:
            # called from instance
            return datetime.utcnow().isoformat()

class Logger:
    current_time = TimeUTC()

Logger.current_time    # <__main__.TimeUTC at 0x7ffb283f62c0>

l = Logger()
l.current_time    # '2022-09-03T03:10:37.410744'
```

1. Notice how the above code works similar to how properties work, if they are called from the Class, they return the descriptor instance and when called from the object instance, they return the value.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Multiple instances of the same class would share the descriptors.
