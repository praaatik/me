## ECMAScript6

- ECMAScript is a language specification standardized by _European Computer Manufacturers Association(ECMA)_.
- All major JavaScript implementations adhere to the ECMAScript standard.
- TC39, is the committee that drafts the ECMAScript specifications. They follow a yearly model for defining new standards, where new features are added as they are approved, rather than waiting till all features are ready. Thus ES7 will contain all features proposed and approved in 2016.

## Block scope variables

- Block is a group of statements delimited under a pair of curly brakcets.
- In JavaScript, `var`, `let` and `const` are used to create variables.
- `let` is used to create Block scoped variables.
  > `let` does not allow properties to be added in the global (or window) scope

```js
function sum([array of args]) {​​​​​​​​
for(var i = 0; i < [array of args].length; i++) {​​​​​​​​
// some code
}​​​​​​​​
// variable i is available here.
}​​​​​​​​

function sum([array of args]) {​​​​​​​​
for(let i = 0; i < [array of args].length; i++) {​​​​​​​​
// some code
}​​​​​​​​
// variable i is not available here.
}
```

- `const` does not allow redefining of the variables.

```js
let x = 10;
x = 20;
// console.log(x) => 20

const x = 10;
x = 20;
//  Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

### Using `freeze`

- Although `const` makes the objects immutable, their values can still be updated. That can be prevented using the `freeze()` function.

```js
const x = { name: "Abc", age: 20 };
x.age = 25;
console.log(x);
//{ name: 'Abc', age: 25 }

const x = Object.freeze({ name: "Abc", age: 20 });
x.age = 25;
console.log(x);
//{ name: 'Abc', age: 20 }
```

## Parameters and arguments

- **Parameters** are given in the function declaration, **arguments** are passed to the function while calling it.
- Consider,

```js
function test(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
test(1, 2);
```

Here `a` and `b` are the _parameters_, while `1` and `2` are the arguments.

> We can initialize default parameters by passing in the values during function declaration.

### Rest parameters

- **Rest** parameters allow _indefinite number_ of parameters in a single notation.

```js
function sum(...args) {
  let result = 0;
  for (const i of result) {
    result += i;
  }
  return result;
}
```

### Spread operator

- **Spread operator** is used to `spread` an array of elements into parameters.

```js
function sum(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}
let args = [1, 2, 3];
let add = sum(...args);
```

- Spread operator can be used for,

1. Concatenation of arrays

```js
var parts = ["shoulder", "knees"];
var bodyParts = ["head", ...parts, "and", "toes"];
```

2. Math functions

```js
let numbers = [9, 4, 7, 1];
console.log(Math.max(...numbers));
```

3. Destructuring arrays and objects,

```js
let [x, y, ...z] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
// => x = 1, y = 2, z = [3,4,5,6]

let { x, y, ...z } = { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3, a: 4 };
// => x = 1, y = 2, z = { z: 3, a: 4 }
```

> Rest collectes all variables into a single array, spread expands single variable in multiple arrays.

## Maps and sets

### Maps

- Maps are objects that associate keys to a value.
- Maps allow both primitives and objects as a key and value.

### Sets

- It is a collection of _unique values_.
- Values can be primitives or objects.

> Primitives cannot be broken down into datatypes further, like `int` in C.

### Weakset and Weakmap

- They are similar to `set` and `map` except,

1. Values can be easily garbage collected.
2. They **cannot** be iterated.
3. Set references are **strong pointers** while weakset references are **weak pointers**, and same for map.
4. Methods like `values()`, `keys`, `entires` do not work on these.
