## Objects and Classes

- In a nutshell, objects are containers which,
  - contain data (_states_ using attributes)
  - contains functionality (_behaviors_ using methods)
- Example, an object of `my_car` could have a states like `brand` of Ferrari, `year` of 2010 and can have behavior like `brake`, `steer`, `accelerate`, etc.
- Classes, also called as _type_ are used to create objects which are called _instances_ of that class.

  {" "}

  <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ Classes are themselves objects. They have attributes (or state) like a
    class name, and they have behavior like creating instance of the class.
  </aside>

- Classes are created from the `type` meta class.

### Creating classes

Using the `class` if we create class like so,

```python
class MyClass:
    pass

m1 = MyClass()
print(type(m1), isinstance(m1, MyClass), MyClass.__name__, type(MyClass.__name__), sep="\n")

"""
Outputs -
<class '__main__.MyClass'>
True
MyClass
<class 'str'>
"""
```

- Here, Python creates an object
  - called `MyClass`
  - of type `type`
  - Automatically provides a certain attributes like `__name__` and methods `MyClass()` (this actually returns an instance of `MyClass`.

## `getattr`, `setattr` and `delattr`

- We can get a particular attribute using the `getattr` method. Shorthand is the use of dot notation.

  ```python
  class MyClass:
      language = 'Python'
      version = 3.10

  print(MyClass.language is getattr(MyClass, 'language'))
  print(MyClass.version is getattr(MyClass, 'version'))
  print(getattr(MyClass, 'isOOP', False))

  """
  True
  True
  False
  """

  setattr(MyClass, 'isOOP', True)

  print(getattr(MyClass, 'isOOP', False) is MyClass.isOOP)    # prints True

  for i in range(10):
      setattr(MyClass, f'{i}th', f'eeyoorii {i+1}')

  for i in range(12):
      print(getattr(MyClass, f'{i}th', 'N/A'))

  """
  eeyoorii 1
  eeyoorii 2
  eeyoorii 3
  eeyoorii 4
  eeyoorii 5
  eeyoorii 6

  eeyoorii 8

  print(MyClass.__dict__)

                '__weakref__': <attribute '__weakref__' of 'MyClass' objects>,

                '9th': 'eeyoorii 10'
                })
  """
  ```

  {" "}

  <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ All the attributes are stored in a `mappingproxy` dictionary. We canâ€™t
    directly mutate it, but we can do that using the `setattr` and `delattr`.
  </aside>

- This dictionary is referred to as the **namespace** of a particular class. Can get the values of the attributes in one of the 3 ways,
  - Preferred way, can specify a backup in case the key is not present.
  ```python
  print(getattr(MyClass, 'isOOP', 'N/A'))
  ```
  - Shorthand way,
  ```python
  print(MyClass.isOOP)
  ```
  - Directly query the dictionary, but not preferred since all attributes might not be present in this dictionary.
  ```python
  print(MyClass.__dict__['isOOP'])
  ```
  [Why is a class **dict** a mappingproxy?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32720492/why-is-a-class-dict-a-mappingproxy)

## Callables

- Any functions which are defined in the class are _callables_.

  ```python
  class Program:
      language = 'Python'

      def say_hello(self):
          print(f"Hello from {self.language}")

      def hey():
          print("hey!")

  print(Program.__dict__)
  """
  mappingproxy({'__module__': '__main__',
                'language': 'Python',
                'say_hello': <function __main__.Program.say_hello(self)>,
                'hey': <function __main__.Program.hey()>,
                '__dict__': <attribute '__dict__' of 'Program' objects>,
                '__weakref__': <attribute '__weakref__' of 'Program' objects>,
                '__doc__': None})
  """

  # can call them like this (although not recommended)
  Program.__dict__['hey']()

  # or this
  p1 = Program()
  p1.say_hello()

  # or this
  getattr(Program, 'hey')()
  ```

  [9. Classes - Python 3.10.2 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)

  ## Instantiating a class

  - When we call a class, a class instance object is created.

    ```python
    class MyClass:
    	pass

    m1 = MyClass() # creates an instance m1 of type MyClass, i.e. type(m1) == MyClass returns True

    class AnotherClass:
        pass

    a1 = AnotherClass()
    print(a1.__dict__, a1.__class__, type(a1), isinstance(a1, AnotherClass), sep="\n")
    """
    {}
    <class '__main__.AnotherClass'>
    <class '__main__.AnotherClass'>
    True
    """
    ```

  - This class instance has itâ€™s own namespace and is distinct from the namespace of the class that was used to create the object, i.e. `m1` has a separate namespace from `MyClass`.
  - This namespace has some attributes which Python automatically implements for us including `__dict__` (_objects local namespace)_ and `__class__` (_which class was used to instantiate the object)_.

  ## Instance Attributes and Class Attributes

  - Instance attributes are the values which are present in the `__dict__` for an object while class attributes are the ones present in the `__dict__` for class.

        ```python
        class MyClass:
            language = 'Python'

        m = MyClass()

        print(m.__dict__, MyClass.__dict__, sep='\n')
        """
        {}
        {'__module__': '__main__', 'language': 'Python', '__dict__': <attribute '__dict__' of 'MyClass' objects>, '__weakref__': <attribute '__weakref__' of 'MyClass' objects>, '__doc__': None}
        """

        m.language = 'JavaScript'
        print(m.__dict__, MyClass.__dict__, sep='\n')

        """
        {'language': 'JavaScript'}
        {'__module__': '__main__', 'language': 'Python', '__dict__': <attribute '__dict__' of 'MyClass' objects>, '__weakref__': <attribute '__weakref__' of 'MyClass' objects>, '__doc__': None}

        """
        ```

          <aside>

    ðŸ’¡ When we get the instance attribute _(say `m.language`)_ Python first checks in the class for the definition. If not present, it would look in `type(MyClass)` if the attribute is present and so on. Goes on to the parent looking for it.

    </aside>

  ## Method Objects

  - method is an actual object type in Python. It is like a function, but it is callable.
  - Unlike a function, method object is actually bound to some object and that object is passed in as the first parameter of the method.

        <aside>

    ðŸ’¡ This method object does not have the parameter passed in when called using the class, but it is done so when called using the instance.

        </aside>

  ```python
  class MyClass:
      def test(*args):
          print(f"Printing the {args}")

  # no parameters passed in when called using the class
  MyClass.test() # Printing the ()

  # parameters passed in when called using the object
  m = MyClass()
  m.test()  # Printing the (<__main__.MyClass object at 0x0000013F025050C0>,)
  ```

  - One advantage is that `test()` now has a handle on the objectâ€™s namespace.
  - Methods are objects that combine an instance of some class and function and like any object is has a few attributes,
    - `__self__` is the instance that method is bound to.
    - `__func__` the original function defined in the class.
  - So when we call the method, `obj.method(args)` it calls `method.__func__(method.__self__, args)` so itâ€™s calling the self first.
  - This means that we need to take into account that _extra_ argument when we define the functions in the classes. These functions are called instance methods.
  - **In a nutshell**, when we call the instance method with arguments, the method receives the instance object reference as the first argument.

        <aside>

    ðŸ’¡ **Methods** in Python have a different meaning from **functions**. Methods are functions which are dumped onto an instance of a class. Refer the code below.

        </aside>

  ```python
  class Person:
  		## the below is a function currently, when the class is intantiated, it becomes a bound method object
      def say_hello():
          print("Saying hello to you!")

  p = Person()
  hex(id(p))    # '0x293e71ad840'

  print(p.say_hello)    # <bound method Person.say_hello of <__main__.Person object at 0x00000293E71AD840>>

  # __self__ just refers to the instance of the class (p in this case)
  print(p.say_hello.__self__ == p)    # True
  ```

## Initializing Class Instances and using `__init__`

- When we instantiate a class, by default Python does two things,
  - creates a new instance of the class
  - initializes the namespace of the class, i.e. gives the object itâ€™s own `__dict__` which is **empty**.
- We can pass in a custom initializer that Python would use using the `__init__` bound instance method.

## Creating Attributes at Run-Time

- Attributes can be created at runtime using the `MethodType` function from `types` module. The benefit of this is that we can create _bounded methods_ for a particular class, _having access to itâ€™s class attributes_, from outside of the class using the object instance.

```python
from types import MethodType

class MyClass:
    age = 2

# age_halfer currently is just a function
def age_halfer(self):
    print(f"Halfing the age now...")
    return self.age / 2

m = MyClass()

print(m.__dict__)    # {}

# with the below line of code, age_halfer becomes a method bound to an object
m.age_halfer = MethodType(age_halfer, m)
m.age_halfer()

print(m.__dict__)    # {'age_halfer': <bound method age_halfer of <__main__.MyClass object at 0x000001F6863D48E0>>}
```

## Properties

- We can create **managed attributes** using the `property()`.
- Usually used with _getters_ and _setters_ in the class for an attribute.
- Useful when we need to make some computation to the attribute before setting or getting it.

```python
class Person:
    """This is a Person object
    """
    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name

    def set_name(self, name):
      if isinstance(name, str) and len(name.strip()) > 0 and isinstance(name, int):
        self._name = name
      else:
        print("Name cannot be a non-empty string or number")

    def get_name(self):
      print(f"Getting the name: {self._name}.")

      return self._name

    def del_name(self):
      print(f"Deleting the name: {self._name}")
      del self._name

    name = property(fget=get_name, fset=set_name, fdel=del_name, doc="The person's name docstring, only for the name not for any other attribute")
```

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y, admin=False):
        self._x = x
        self._y = y
        self._admin = admin

    def get_x(self):
        if(self._admin):
            print("Getting the value of x.\n")
            return self._x
        else:
            print("Not authorized!")

    def get_y(self):
        if(self._admin):
            print("Getting the value of y.\n")
            return self._y
        else:
            print("Not authorized!")

    def set_x(self, x):
        if(self._admin) and x > 0:
            print(f"Setting the value of x to {x}")
            self._x = x
        else:
            print("Authentication error.")

    def set_y(self, y):
        if(self._admin) and y > 0:
            print(f"Setting the value of y to {y}")
            self._y = y
        else:
            print("Authentication error.")

    x = property(fget=get_x, fset=set_x)
    y = property(fget=get_y, fset=set_y)
```

## Deleting Properties

- Properties can be deleted using the `@property_name.deleter` decorator.
- Consider the example below,

  ```python
  class UnitCirle:
      def __init__(self, color):
          self._color = color

      @property
      def color(self):
          print("getting the color")
          return self._color

      @color.deleter
      def color(self):
          print("deleting the color")
          del self._color

      @color.setter
      def color(self, value):
          print("setting the color")
          self._color = value
  ```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Note that this does not delete the Class attribute but deletes the instance attribute. Trying to get the instance attribute *after* deleting it results in an `AttributeError`.

</aside>

## Class and Static Methods

- When we define a function in a class, how we call it alters the behavior of the function,
  ```python
  class MyClass:
  	def hello():
  		pass
  ```
  - If we call it like, `MyClass.hello` it is just a _plain function_.
  - If we call it using an instance, `m = MyClass(); m.hello` it would be a _method bound_ to an object `m`.
- Instead now to create a function which would be _bound to_ Class in either cases, we use the `@classmethod` decorator. In that case, however we call it, it would be bound to `MyClass` in the above example.

  ```python
  class MyClass:
      def hello():
          print("hello")

      def inst_hello(self):
          print(f"hello from {self}")

      @classmethod
      def cls_hello(cls):
          print(f"hello from {cls}")

  		@staticmethod
      def help():
          print("help called")
  ```

| Function Name | MyClass               | Instance                 | Comments                                   | Arguments                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| hello         | regular function here | method bound to instance | Call will fail since no self in arguments. | N/A                                                                                                           |
| inst_hello    | regular function here | method bound to instance | Call will work                             | Function bound to instance when called from instance - will receive instance as the first parameter           |
| cls_hello     | method bound to class | method bound to class    | Call will work                             | function bound to class when called from either class or instance - will receive class as the first parameter |
| help          | regular function here | regular function here    | Call will work                             | Static method is never bound to anything - receives no extra argument no matter how it is called.             |

- Now, if we want functions which are not bound to anything, neither a class nor an instance, we use `@staticmethod` decorator.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Class Methods accept the `cls` parameter which points to the class itself and not the object instance. Because of this, they donâ€™t modify the instance states directly (as that requires `self`) but modify the class states which applies to all the instances of the class.

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Another way to look at the *class methods* is that they allow to define alternative constructors for the classes.

[Difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36798076/6438526)

## Scopes for Classes

- Variables are stored inside the class scope.
- Functions inside of classes are stored inside of module level.
- When looking up for a variable inside of a class, Python looks in the class scope first and then in the module scope.
- When looking up a function inside of a class, Python looks in the module scope directly.
- Example code with explanation

  ```python
  class Account:
      COMP_FRQ = 12
      APR = 0.02
      APY = (1 + APR/COMP_FRQ) ** COMP_FRQ - 1

      def __init__(self, balance):
          self.balance = balance

      def monthly_interest(self):
          """
          This works since we are using a bound method to refer to the class variable.
          """
          return self.balance * self.APY

      @classmethod
      def monthly_interest_2(cls, amount):
          """
          This works as well since we are using the class instance to refer to the APY class variable.
          """
          return amount * cls.APY

      @staticmethod
      def monthly_interest_3(amount):
          """
          This works as well because we are actually using the classname (Account) to refer to the class variable.
          Note that Python would look in the module if it does not find APY in here, i.e. without a Account
          """
          return amount * Account.APY

      def monthly_interest_4(amount):
          """
          This would not work because Python does not find APY in the module level (since these functions are stored in module level).
          """
          return amount * APY
  ```

## Weird Example

```python
name = 'Mikki'

class MyClass:
    name = 'Kitty'
    list_1 = [name] * 3
    list_2 = [name for i in range(2)]

    @classmethod
    def hello(cls):
        return f'{name} says hello'

print(MyClass.hello(), MyClass.list_1, MyClass.list_2, sep="\n")

"""
Mikki says hello
['Kitty', 'Kitty', 'Kitty']
['Mikki', 'Mikki']
