# Pi-Peekaboo

This project was one of my early ones. It is a React-based application that searches for a sequence of numbers within Pi's first one million digits. It was a unique project for me because it was one of the first times I had contributed to an open-source project.

This project is inspired by the amazing YouTube channel The Coding Train.

## Technologies used

- ReactJS

## What's cool about it?

- My first contribution to an open-source project which allowed me to practice my coding skills in ReactJS.

## What could be better?

- The code standards could have been more professional.
