# Movie Tracker

I created the Movie Tracker web application to solve my problem of wanting an easy-to-use tool to track the movies I have watched or want to watch. Built using React, TypeScript, and Material UI, with Supabase for backend and authentication, the app includes features such as saving movie names, genres, ratings, release year, and more. Users can add, delete, and edit their existing movies, and multiple users can sign up and use the app.

## Technologies used

- React
- TypeScript
- Material UI
- Supabase
- Redux Toolkit Query

## What's cool about it

- The app includes many features for tracking movies, including name, genre, rating, and release year.
- React and TypeScript allowed me to create a robust front-end for the app, while Material UI made creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface easy.
- Working with Supabase allowed me to gain valuable experience with database integration, authentication, and working with APIs.
- Multiple users can sign up and use the app.

## What could be better

- One limitation of the project is that testing was not included, an essential aspect of software development.
- The UI could be more responsive, as I was still learning Material UI at the time of development.
- The project also had a relatively narrow focus on movie tracking, limiting its utility for broader use cases.
