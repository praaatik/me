## Dictionaries and Sets

---

## Associative Arrays

- Apples
- Oranges
- Berries
  - Strawberries
  - Raspberries

* An associative array is an abstract data structure.
* They have keys (_unique_) mapped to values
* Think, collection of (key, value) pair.
* AKA â‡’ maps, dictionaries
* Need to support
  - adding/removing elements
  - modifying an element
  - lookup a value using the keys

---

## Dictionaries in Python

- Key ordering is preserved in a dictionary since Python 3.6+.
- Since dictionaries need to store a key along with the value, the memory overhead is larger than an array. Arrays are compact, but slower compared to dictionaries.
- Python needs to keep at least $\frac{1}{3}^{rd}$ of the rows empty to remain efficient.
- To save memory, avoid creating instance attributes outside of the `__init__` method, because if we do add them afterwards, Python needs to re-compute the space required and adds space if required.

### Creating dictionaries

- Basic structure of a Dictionary is key : value
- Keys need to be **hashable objects** like strings, numbers, etc. Lists are **never** hashable since they are mutable objects.
- Values on the other hand can be any objects.

---

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Hashes in Python returned by the `hash()` are randomized because of collisions. More collisions â‡’ slower dictionaries.

</aside>

### Creating Dictionaries: Literals

Just create a dictionary using the literals like so,

```python
{
key1: value1,
key2: value2
}
```

### Creating dictionaries: Constructor

You can also use the `dict()` constructor, but the key here should be a valid identifier. You can't use a tuple as a key in this case, since it's not a valid identifier.

```python
dict(key1=value1, key2=value2)
```

```python
o = tuple((0, 0, 0))
a = tuple((0, 1, 1))
b = tuple((0, 2, 3))

dict_2 = {o: 'origin', a: 'Point a', b: 'Point b'}    #valid
dict_3 = dict(o='origin', a='Point a', b='Point b')    #valid
~~dict_4 = dict(o='origin', a='Point a', b='Point b', (0, 0): 'Point c')    #invalid!~~
```

### Dictionary Comprehensions

```python
{str(i): i**3 for i in range(0, 10)}    #dictionary
{i**3 for i in range(0, 10)}    #set
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Note the **key** has been mentioned before the colon, if you were to forget that, it would make it a **set** instead.

</aside>

### Creating Dictionary: `fromkeys()`

- This is a class method on `dict`
- It creates a dictionary with specified keys all assigned the same value (if not specified)
- Values if not specified are defaulted to `None`.
- Keys need to be an iterable and hashable elements.

```python
d = dict.fromkeys([i**3 for i in range(0, 10)])
```

---

## Shallow and Deep copies in Dictionaries

- Consider a dictionary <inlineCode> d = {'a': 100, 'b': 200} </inlineCode>
- If we were to copy this dictionary like so,
  ```python
  d1 = dict(d)
  ```

this would create a shallow copy of the dictionary `d` which means that any modifications done in `d` **would reflect** in `d1`.

---

## Basic Operations in Dictionaries

### Getting values from dictionary

- `d[key] = value` creates a new key if not already present and assigns the value to the key
- `d[key]` gets the value of the key, throws a `KeyError` if value is not present
- `d.get(key)` would instead give `None` if value is not found
- Can also specify the default return value if element is not found using, `d.get(key, default)`

### Deleting/Clearing Values from dictionary

- `d.clear()` would clear a dictionary, but the dictionary would remain present
- `d = {}` would also clear a dictionary, but a new object would be set to `d` instead of in place clearing

  ```python
  print(id(d))
  d = {}
  print(id(d))

  ## Notice the ids have changed
  #2820734602048
  #2820734626688

  print(id(d))
  d.clear()
  print(id(d))

  ## Notice ids remain the same
  #2820704960640
  #2820704960640
  ```

- `del d[key]` removes the key from the element
- `d.pop(key)` removes the item and returns the corresponding value, `KeyError` if key is not present, can also use a default like `d.pop(key, default)`
- `d.popitem()` returns a key, value tuple of the item removed. Since order is preserved, the last item is removed. _Valid only for Python 3.6+ where order is preserved._

### Setting values in a dictionary

- `d.setdefault(key, value)` would set check if the key is present. If present, it returns the value already present. If not, it sets the value and returns the newly set value.

---

## Dictionary Views

- Dictionary views are **read-only** projections of the internal data structures used in the `dict` implementation.
- Dictionaries can be accessed like,

  - `d.keys()` â‡’ which returns the keys
  - `d.values()` â‡’ which returns all the values
  - `d.items()` â‡’ which returns all the items present in the dictionary

  ```python
  d = {13: 169}

  keys = d.keys()
  values = d.values()
  items = d.items()

  print(keys, values, items)
  print(type(keys), type(values), type(items))

  """ Returns
  dict_keys([13]) dict_values([169]) dict_items([(13, 169)])
  <class 'dict_keys'> <class 'dict_values'> <class 'dict_items'>
  """
  ```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ These are dynamic, which means if we were to store the `keys()`, `values()` and `items()` in any variable and then update the dictionary, the variables would be updated automatically with the new values.

</aside>

- `keys()` view is more than an iterable and behaves like a set. Unions, intersection , difference can be performed on them, like a set.
- `values()` **do not** behave like a set, since the values can be non-unique.
- `items()` _may_ behave like a set since the tuple returned **should** be unique. If all values are hashable, then it behaves like a set.

### Set operations on Dictionary views

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ A `dict_items` view only works if all the set values in `dict` are hashable, if not we get a `TypeError`. `dict_keys` on the other hand can be used as a set, since keys are hashable by definition.

</aside>

## Updating, Merging and Copying

### Merging

- In Python 3.10, the merging of dictionaries can be done with the pipe symbol.

  ```python
  d1 = {i: j for i, j in zip('abc', [1, 2, 3])}
  print(f"d1 = {d1}")

  d2 = {i: j for i, j in zip('cde', [3, 2, 1])}
  print(f"d2 = {d2}")

  print(d1 | d2)

  d3 = {}
  d3 |= d2
  d3 |= d1
  print(d3)

  print(d3 == (d1 | d2))
  """
  d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
  d2 = {'c': 3, 'd': 2, 'e': 1}
  {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 2, 'e': 1}
  {'c': 3, 'd': 2, 'e': 1, 'a': 1, 'b': 2}
  True
  """

  ```

In place merging can also be done with `|=`.

- Other ways of merging would be using the unpacking operator like so,

  ```python
  d1 = {i: j for i, j in zip('abc', [1, 2, 3])}
  print(f"d1 = {d1}")

  d2 = {i: j for i, j in zip('cde', [3, 2, 1])}
  print(f"d2 = {d2}")

  d3 = {**d1, **d2}
  print(d3)

  print(d3 == (d1 | d2))

  """
  d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
  d2 = {'c': 3, 'd': 2, 'e': 1}
  {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 2, 'e': 1}
  {'c': 3, 'd': 2, 'e': 1, 'a': 1, 'b': 2}
  True
  """
  ```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Unpacking an iterable is `*iterable` and unpacking a dictionary is `**dictionary`

</aside>

## Copying

### Shallow Copies

- Container object is a new object, but keys and values are a shared references with the original object
- Ways to perform a shallow copy â‡’
  - `d_copy = d.copy()`
  - `d_copy = {**d}`
  - `d_copy = dict(d)`
  - `d_copy = {k: v for k, v in d.items()}` _slower_
- Dictionaries are independent _(so inserts, updates are independent)_ but keys and values are shared references
- What that means is â‡’ the dictionaries are independent with different IDs, but the keys and values are shared having same IDs. If we were to update any particular key/value then they would be different. Look at the code below.

  ```python
  d1 = {i: j for i, j in zip('abc', [1, 2, 3])}

  print(f"d1 = {d1} and id = {id(d1)}")
  # d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3} and id = 1540771055552

  d_copy_1 = d1.copy()
  print(f"d_copy_1 = {d_copy_1} and id = {id(d_copy_1)}")

  d_copy_1.update(a=100)
  print(f"d_copy_1 = {d_copy_1} and id = {id(d_copy_1)}")
  print(f"d1 = {d1} and id = {id(d1)}")

  """
  Notice how the IDs of the dictionaries themselves are different
  d_copy_1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3} and id = 1540756810880
  d_copy_1 = {'a': 100, 'b': 2, 'c': 3} and id = 1540756810880
  d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3} and id = 1540771055552
  """

  for i in d1.keys():
      print(d1[i] is d_copy_1[i])

  """
  But the individual keys are separated once they are updated, 'a' in this case
  False
  True
  True
  """
  ```

### Deep Copies

- Just use `copy.deepcopy` to create a deep copy of a dictionary, iterable, etc.

# Shallow Copy, Deep Copy, Normal Assignments

```python
import copy

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
c = [a, b]
```

- Shallow Copy

  ```python
  d = copy.copy(c)

  print id(c) == id(d)          # False - d is now a new object
  print id(c[0]) == id(d[0])    # True - d[0] is the same object as c[0]
  ```

- Deep Copy

  ```python
  d = copy.deepcopy(c)

  print id(c) == id(d)          # False - d is now a new object
  print id(c[0]) == id(d[0])    # False - d[0] is now a new object
  ```

- Normal Assignment

  ```python
  d = c

  print id(c) == id(d)          # True - d is the same object as c
  print id(c[0]) == id(d[0])    # True - d[0] is the same object as c[0]
  ```

## Calling the `hash` function

- In reality, `hash(p)` would look for `p.__hash__`
  - `p.__hash__ = None` â‡’ `p` is not hashable
  - Else, calls `p.__hash__()`
  - Truncates returned integer to 32-bit or 64-bit (_depending on the Python version_)
- `hash(p) == p.__hash__() % sys.hash_info.modulus`

---

## Custom Classes, Hashes and Equalities

- If we were to have a custom class and we were to create 2 instances like below,

  ```python
  class Person:
      def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
          self.first_name = first_name
          self.last_name = last_name

      def __repr__(self):
          return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"

  p1 = Person("Pratik", "Kulkarni")
  p2 = Person("Pratik", "Kulkarni")
  ```

right now, `p1` and `p2` would not be equal, they would be separate objects with different hashes. Hence,

```python
p1 == p2    #False
hash(p1) == hash(p2)    #False
```

- When 2 objects are compared, they are checked using their hashes. So, `p1 == p2` â‡’ `p1 is p2` â‡’ `id(p1) == id(p2)` â‡’ `hash(p1) == hash(p2)`.
- Even if we were to insert them in a dictionary with the key as the objects, they would be treated as different keys with different values. To avoid this, we could implement the `__eq__` method in the class and make sure that they are treated equally.
- Once we do that though, the `__hash__` is immediately set to `None` which makes sense since `p1 == p2` but `p1 is not p2`, so there's a contradiction. Hence, we could also make it return `None`.

---

# Sets

- An unordered collection of distinct objects where ordering is not important.
- In Python to implement a set, elements must be _hashable_ and _distinct_.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ To check if two sets are disjoint we could do `len(s1 & s2)` and check if it's value is zero. If it is, they are disjoint. Or just use the `s1.isdisjoint(s2)`.

</aside>

- Sets are iterable and can be unpacked like, `*s`. The order in which they are unpacked is unknown.

## Subsets and Supersets

- To check if `s1` is a subset of `s2`
  - `s1 <= s2`
  - `s1.issubset(s2)`
- To check for a proper subset
  - `s1 < s2`
- To check if `s1` is a superset of `s2`
  - `s1 >= s2`
  - `s1.issuperset(s2)`
- To check for proper superset
  - `s1 > s2`

## Unions and Intersections

- To check for union of 2 sets,
  - `s1 | s2 | ...`
  - `s1.union(s2, ...)`
- To check for intersection of 2 sets,
  - `s1 & s2 & ...`
  - `s1.intersection(s2, ...)`

## Difference and Symmetric Difference

- Difference between 2 sets can be checked by
  - `s1 - s2`
- **This operation is not commutative.**
- Symmetric difference on the other hand is,
  - `s1 ^ s2`
  - `s1.symmetric_difference(s2)`

---

## Frozen Sets

- These are the immutable equivalent of sets _(think of tuples for lists)_
- Elements must be unique and hashable. They have no order.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ To get the size of a dictionary/set/list, we can use the `__sizeof__()` method `d.__sizeof__()`

</aside>
