# Photogram

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- Firestore (for data storage)

## Description

Photogram is a simple web application that allows users to store and search for photos by tags. The app works well, considering it was developed when I was learning to code using React, and it allowed me to tinker with Firebase for the backend and authentication.

## What's cool about it?

- Simple and easy-to-use web app
- Great opportunity to learn and work with React, Firebase, and Firestore technologies
- Provides basic functionality for photo storage and search

## What could be better?

A lot of things, actually,

- UI could be improved to make it more intuitive and user-friendly
- Limited functionality, as it only supports essential photo storage and retrieval
- No method of bulk uploads
- No tests are present
