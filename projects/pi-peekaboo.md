# Pi-Peekaboo

This project was one of my early ones. It is a React-based application that searches for a sequence of numbers within Pi's first one million digits. It was a unique project for me because it was one of the first times I had contributed to an open-source project.

This project is inspired by The Coding Train, particularly this coding challenge.

## What's cool about it?
